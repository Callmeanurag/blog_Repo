Technology is evolving around. Every day something new is emerging as a buzz and DevOps is one of the hot buzzes right now. The Grand View Research study forecasts that the DevOps market will reach 12.85 Billion USD by 2025. This is huge.........!!!!!

Now, you might be thinking, What is DevOps and why is this becoming so popular? So to answer your query, we need to take a deep dive and learn what DevOps is, its history, and why we need DevOps.

Let's start with "What is DevOps"?

DevOps is a combination of two words where Dev stands for Development and Ops stands for Operations. It combines development and operations to unit people, processes, and technology in application planning, development, delivery, and operations. Which automates and integrates the processes between application development and IT teams.

Like SDLC, it also has phases. Remember the logo of DevOps? That "Infinite" shape?? Which actually represents the phases of DevOps.

This infinite shape represents the 8 phases of DevOps, which are

1. Plan
    
2. Code
    
3. Build
    
4. Test
    
5. Release
    
6. Deploy
    
7. Operation
    
8. Monitor
    

Phase 1 to 5 comes under Dev and the remaining 6,7 and 8 come under Ops, which combines together to form DevOps.

Now, if we talk about the Lifecycle of DevOps, then its life depends upon 5 cycles.

Starting from **Continuous Development**, the lifecycle goes to **Continuous Testing** followed by **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** and then the last one is **Continuous Monitoring**.

In each of these processes, there are different tools that we use to achieve our goal. For example, for continuous development, we use GIT, Mercurial, Jira, Maven, etc.

For continuous testing, automation tools like TestNG, Selenium, JUnit, etc are used. In this phase, Docker containers can be also used for simulating the test environment.

For continuous integration, Jenkins is a very popular tool used in this phase.

In continuous deployment, we have Chef, SaltStack, and Ansible. Containerization tools are also playing an essential role in the deployment phase. Vagrant and Docker are popular tools that are used for this purpose.

In continuous monitoring, we have Splunk, ELK Stack, Nagios, NewRelic, and Sensu tools available.

Since DevOps is all about increasing coordination between development and operational teams, it directly translates into shorter development cycles of time increasing the pace of code release into production. And that is the reason why organizations are accepting DevOps. But there is one more important factor of DevOps that allows organizations to accept it rapidly and that is Automation. So let's have a look at it.

### What is Automation

Automation in DevOps is the additional advantage of technology that perform tasks that reduce human assistance between the development team and the operational team so that the updates can be deployed faster.

To become successful in DevOps, Automation is essential. It helps accelerate processes and scale environments and build Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

DevOps and automation can provide consistency across repetitive tasks by configuring an automation tool and removing the threat of human error. As well as increase the speed of the team from code integration to application deployment. It also creates a much more reliable and stable system due to improved collaboration. Therefore this reduces a reduction in errors from miscommunication.

Automation is scalable when managing multiple applications, and/or environments, all while remaining consistent.

So what is Scaling in DevOps??? Let's talk about it now.

### What is Scaling

If you are having a basic knowledge of Cloud Computing, then you might understand the term Scaling or Scale. So scaling is a process of cloud computing model to adapt to changing requirements either by increasing or by decreasing its resources such as Computational power, storage, or network capacity depending on demand.

It's all related to Cloud Computing, so why do we need scaling in DevOps even if we can scale in our cloud service provider? So, in the context of DevOps, scaling is characterized as an **automation-driven** environment where developers or any organization can adopt DevOps culture and choose the right technologies to scale their business growth.

Automation ensures that the development process is easier to audit, safeguard, improve, and comprehend. Modern tools are available for every stage of the SDLC. Whether it is code packaging, version control management, compiling build, testing, configuration management, or monitoring, you can automate each and every process.

A successfully scaled DevOps promotes mutual collaboration among teams, reduced bottlenecks in deliveries, faster feedback cycles, and resilient product updates.Â There is no single recipe to scale DevOps, as the needs of every company vary.

### What is Infrastructure

Infrastructure in DevOps refers to a concept that revolves around the idea of managing infrastructure with the help of code. This is done with the help of certain tools or programs which can help to carry out the tasks automatically. Some of the leading IAC tools are listed below.

* Ansible
    
* Terraform
    
* SaltStack
    
* CloudFormation
    
* Azure Resource Manager
    
* SpectralOps
    

There might be a number of factors such as irregular allocation of resources, lack of metrics, fragmented procedures, and misalignment or improper allocation of responsibilities, that might prevent an organization from adopting and scaling the DevOps practices at full length. Of all the roadblocks, improper infrastructure management might be the most troublesome. When infrastructure is properly managed, it makes sure that the resources are configured properly, secured, backed up on a regular basis, and monitored from time to time.

### Why DevOps is Important

Till now, we have talked all about DevOps but why this DevOps is important? Even when DevOps was not introduced, even then the organizations were working, so what happened now that it became so important?

If I have to answer this in a short and single line, then I'll say "DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments."

But this is not enough, let's dig it down.

DevOps is built on the concept of Agile methodologies but applies it to the entire software delivery process, from planning to deployment. The main goal of DevOps is to bring together all the stakeholders involved in a project, like developers, testers, operations staff, and business users, so they can work together as a team.

One important key benefit of DevOps is that it allows teams to work more closely with business users, who can provide valuable feedback early on in the process. This helps ensure that products meet user needs, rather than simply meeting technical requirements. Another benefit is that it enables developers and operations staff to work more closely together. This leads to better communication across the team and improved efficiency throughout the development cycle.
