### How to Rock This Project

### 1\. **Kickoff Your Terraform Code**

Get your Terraform project up and running.

1. **Set Up Shop**: Create a new directory for your Terraform project and dive in via your terminal.
    
2. **Start Coding**: Create a file named [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) to begin your configuration.
    

#Bonus: Run `terraform -v` to confirm Terraform is installed and ready to go!

### 2\. **Plug into Spotify**

In [`main.tf`](http://main.tf), set up the Spotify provider:

```plaintext
provider "spotify" {
  api_key = "?"
}
```

### 3\. Grab Your API Key

To connect with Spotify‚Äôs API, you'll need a Client ID and Client Secret.

### 4\. Kickstart your App

### 5\. Store Your Credentials

Create a `.env` file to securely stash your Spotify Client ID and Secret!

```plaintext
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>
```

### 6\. Fire Up the Spotify Auth App and Grab Your API Key

Ensure Docker Desktop is up and running, then launch the authorization proxy server to get your API key!

```plaintext
docker run --rm -it -p 27228:27228 --env-file .env ghcr.io/conradludgate/spotify-auth-proxy
```

I have my .env file in the same project folder, that's why I am using `.env`
